# Assignment 

Due to hardware problems and limiations because of working from home all work has been presented in .ipynb notebooks instead of .py files.
I was unable to run python localy so would have been unable to test .py files

## preprocessing.ipynb
Run all to download data and preprocess it. Data collected and processed is output in data.zip which is uploaded in this repository. Download this file and upload it to run time of other files to use the data.
The zip file contains csv files of all the dataframes needed.

## plots.ipynb
To run first upload data.zip to runtime. This file plots the data as seen in the report (figures 1-3). Also contains bootstrapping and an linear regression implementation. 

## AIBias.ipynb
To run first upload data.zip to runtime. This file uses packages from the AIF360 toolkit, this is installed in the fist line along with all its requirments This file contains the bias detection and machine learning algorithms used in the project. I use the sklearn LogisiticRegression module for this.
